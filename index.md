I am a senior lecturer (equivalent to associate professor in North American universities) at the [School of Computer Science](https://ecms.adelaide.edu.au/computer-science/), [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). 

Toward the goal of augmenting human, my primary research themes are augmenting human creativity and augmenting human-machine interface. I am particularly interested in creating novel interaction systems by integrating brain-computer interface (BCI) and mixed-reality (MR) displays.
