I am a senior lecturer (tenured assistant professor in other systems) at the [School of Computer Science](https://set.adelaide.edu.au/computer-and-mathematical-sciences/), [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). Before joining Adelaide, I had the honor of working with [Prof. Patrick Baudisch](https://hpi.de/baudisch/home.html) (HPI), [Prof. Takeo Igarashi](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/) (U of Tokyo), [Prof CT Lin](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/chin-teng.lin) (UTS), and [Dr. Li-Yi Wei](https://www.liyiwei.org) (Adobe Research) across various research fields including Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics, and AI/ML.

My research mission is to **augment human capabilities by engineering human-centred AI systems**. I pursue this mission by actively exploring emerging technologies to build novel interactive AI systems that empower and collaborate effectively with knowledge workers. This hands-on pursuit has led to my leadership roles in large interdisciplinary teams, including serving as the U of Adelaide research lead for the [Augmenting Ability CRC](https://augmentingabilitycrc.com.au/) and as the human-AI interface lead for the [Eureka Prize-winning](https://australian.museum/get-involved/eureka-prizes/2023-eureka-prize-winners/), MRFF-funded [IMAGENDO Project](https://imagendo.org.au/). These shaped my exploration of human-AI interaction through three evolving paradigms: **AI as Assistant**, **AI as Collaborator**, and **AI as Oracle**.
