I am a senior lecturer (equivalent to associate professor in North American universities) at the [School of Computer Science](https://ecms.adelaide.edu.au/computer-science/), [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). Before joining Adelaide, I were honored to work with [Prof. Patrick Baudisch](https://hpi.de/baudisch/home.html) (HPI), [Prof. Takeo Igarashi](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/) (U of Tokyo), [Prof CT Lin](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/chin-teng.lin) (UTS), and [Dr. Li-Yi Wei](https://www.liyiwei.org) (Adobe Research) across different research fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics, Brain-Computer Interface, and AI. 

My main research interest lies in building interactive AIs that cooperate and collaborate seamlessly with humans. My recent works focus on augmenting human performance and decision making with interpretable and context-aware AI in the metaverse.
