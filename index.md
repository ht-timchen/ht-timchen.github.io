I am a senior lecturer (equivalent to associate professor in North American universities) at the [School of Computer Science](https://ecms.adelaide.edu.au/computer-science/), [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). My main research interest is in utilizing emerging technologies to design interactive AI systems that seamlessly collaborate with knowledge workers. Currently, my research projects focus on spatial computing and human-centered AI in healthcare. I am a CI of the [IMAGENDO Project](https://imagendo.org.au/), which won the [2023 Australian Museum Eureka Prize](https://australian.museum/get-involved/eureka-prizes/2023-eureka-prize-winners/) (the "Oscars" of Australian science) for using AI for endometriosis diagnosis.

Before joining Adelaide, I was honored to have worked with [Prof. Patrick Baudisch](https://hpi.de/baudisch/home.html) (HPI), [Prof. Takeo Igarashi](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/) (U of Tokyo), [Prof CT Lin](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/chin-teng.lin) (UTS), and [Dr. Li-Yi Wei](https://www.liyiwei.org) (Adobe Research) across different research fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics, Brain-Computer Interface, and AI.
